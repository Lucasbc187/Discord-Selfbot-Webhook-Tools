# Discord-Selfbot-Webhook-Tools
A Discord Selfbot with webhook tools to delete,spam and send messages
So I'm beginning in programming and I decided to make a selfbot to mess with webhooks.
I might add more commands and make a better code, for now thats it!
Make sure open and read main.py i added explanation for each thing

# PS.
# Selfbots are against ToS, if someone see you are using it, you might get reported and 
# permanently banned from acess to your account
# I'm not responsible of nothing that happens to your account! 
# Be carefully!

# ERROR and INFO
# For module not found - Open cmd and type pip install + {module}
# I coded using Python 3.8.0 make sure to add to path in setup

# Explanation
# Selfbots use tokens to login the bot to the account
# Token | Don't give your token to others. It gives full acess to your account. 
# Keep it private, when you change password your token changes

# If you don't know how to get your token

# First Command  | Delete Webhook
# Usage : prefix($)delhook + webhook link
# It deletes a webhook without being in the server or having perms to do it.
# Casually used to delete webhooks from token grabbers (my intention for yall use it)
# args goes for webhook link

# Second Command | Send Webhook
# Usage : prefix($)sendhook + (message) + webhook link to send message.
# Simple code to send messages to webhooks (without spamming).
# hook_url goes for webhook link
# args goes for message/content

# Third Command | Spam Webhook (unsafe!)
# Usage : prefix($)spamhook + message + webhooklink
# Spamming webhook with a message nonstop
# You might get rate limited from Discord so, I highly recommend using a VPN to avoid it.
# Basically they block your IP from discord for some mins 
# Why? You are abusing the API 
# When you get rate limited you won't be able to send messages,login or any other thing
# It usually takes 30 min and then you will be able to have acess to discord
